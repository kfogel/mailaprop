Body of test message 6.

In this message, the sender's name is identical to the email address,
and therefore should not be included as a name in the output.  But
because that same sender address has been seen on older dates (2016
and before), that sender should still get this new 2017 date.

Body of test message 7.

In this message, the sender is me, so it should get a special
sent-count score internally.
